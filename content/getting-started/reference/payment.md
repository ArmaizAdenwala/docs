Section supports a number of payment methods.  

## Credit Card

The default payment method is by credit card which can be added to your account in the billing portal.  

Section stores all credit card details in secure vaults provided by our payment gateway providers.  We do not store any credit card information on the Section platform.

Add or Update your credit card, visit the Section Billing Portal: first click on the "gear" icon in your menu then navigate to "Account". Here you will find the "Visit Billing Portal" button which will take you to our hosted billing portal.  You have the option to set up a unique password for your billing portal.

Within the Billing Portal, you can attach different payment methods to each website.

Note: Section does not currently support American Express as a valid credit card payment method.

## Other Billing Methods

Section also supports invoice and 12 and 24 month contracts with discounts available for longer term agreements.  Please [contact us](https://www.section.io/contact-us) to discuss alternate billing methods.
