Section.io's Developer PoP runs on Kubernetes. Minikube is a prepackaged Kubernetes cluster that works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Minikube runs on your preference of virtual machine ([VirtualBox] is a free option).

1. Verify that you have installed VirtualBox or another VM software.
1. Download and install <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/tag/v0.26.1" target="Minikube" title="Minikube v0.26.1 download">Minikube v0.26.1</a>.
1. Start minikube: `minikube start`
1. Initialize the Developer PoP:
```
minikube ssh "docker run --rm --net=host -v /var/lib/localkube:/var/lib/localkube:ro sectionio/section-init"
```
 If you have installed Minikube v0.29.0 or later you will need to use this initialization command instead:
```
minikube ssh "docker run --rm --net=host -v /var/lib/minikube:/var/lib/localkube:ro -v /var/lib/minikube:/var/lib/minikube:ro sectionio/section-init"
```

Note that after each one of these terminal commands, you will need to wait a few moments for Minikube to fully launch all the section.io containers. If you, for example, try and do the git pushes in the next section immediately after completing the `minikube ssh` command above, you may find that the git daemon or some other relevant component has not yet come online. In this case, just wait for a few minutes â€” the exact time depends upon the speed of your internet connection and specifications of your machine.

Disable repeating messages about the **kubectl** component you won't need: `minikube config set WantKubectlDownloadMsg false`

Now your Developer PoP base is ready, but it has not yet launched any of the specific proxies in your configuration.

Let's change that by [loading your section.io setup into the Developer PoP]({{< relref "tutorials/developer-workflow/loading-your-setup-into-the-developer-pop.md" >}}).
