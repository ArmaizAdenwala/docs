### Locally Override DNS to point at the Developer PoP

You will need to modify your local host file and point the **Hosted Name(s)** for your service at `192.168.99.100`.

    192.168.99.100    www.example.com

This will override the DNS endpoint for that domain and force traffic through the Dev PoP and then to your origin address. That could be your production webserver, production load balancer, development webserver â€” whatever you configured for in the Dev PoP UI.

Now when you browse to your site URL, the HTTP traffic will be flowing through the Developer PoP!

### Making changes to your configuration

Now that you have traffic flowing through the Dev PoP you will be able to change any configuration and see it live within a few seconds.

Using your favorite IDE open the repository you cloned from Aperture. Whether you have Varnish, PageSpeed, or a Web Application Firewall, you can change the configuration to see how your application will behave.

Once you have made changes to your config, you will want to push them to the Dev PoP to see them in action. Again we will be using a typical git workflow:

1. Stage your changes: `git add .`.
2. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Some relevant message here"`.
3. Push your changes: `git push developer-pop`.
4. If you have syntax errors git will provide feedback. You may need to make adjustments and go back to step 1.
5. Go back to your browser, reload the page, and see what type of optimizations your changes made.
