Unlike Legacy CDNs which generally are fixed on a single proxy, Section allows you to choose the proxies that suit your application architecture.

You can run a single proxy, or run multiple proxies to combine the power of many.

Depending on your need:

* **Performance**: Varnish Cache  (versions 3, 4, and 5). Google's PageSpeed. Nginx, and Nginx+Lua.
* **Scalability**: Varnish Cache . Nginx.
* **Availability**: Varnish Cache . Nginx+Lua.
* **Security**: ModSecurity. ThreatX. Signal Sciences.

These are just some of the reverse proxies that are available to you. Pick the right combination and painlessly change them as your requirements change.

All these proxies are available throughout the entire [development lifecycle]({{< relref "tutorials/overview/developer-ready.md" >}}).
