Section is built to streamline the process of managing groups of websites.

If you work at an agency, you're familiar with the unique challenges that come with overseeing large groups of sites. You want to be able to:

* log in with one user account for yourself and see all your client sites.
* give separate logins to individual clients so that they can see only their data and not that of your other clients.
* bill your customers independently, so that you don't have to think about how much to charge each client.

Section account structure is set up to do just that. Additionally, the Section platform allows you to apply a single proxy configuration to groups of sites at once and update them all with the click of a button.

Each site that runs on [Section Application Edge runs on a Global Network]({{< relref "tutorials/overview/global-network.md">}}).
