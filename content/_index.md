Everything you need to know about Section

## How the documentation is organized

Section has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how itâ€™s organized will help you know where to look for certain things:

* [Tutorials]({{< relref "tutorials/_index.md" >}}) provide step-by-step instructions to implement something within Section.
* [Topic guides]({{< relref "topic-guides/_index.md" >}}) discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.
* [How-to guides]({{< relref "how-to/_index.md" >}}) are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Section works.
* [Reference guides]({{< relref "reference/_index.md" >}}) contain technical reference for APIs and other aspects of Section.
