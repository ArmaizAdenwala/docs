### How the documentation is organized

Section has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how itâ€™s organized will help you know where to look for certain things:

* **General topic guides** are key topics and concepts related to Section and they each have the following sections:
  * **Overview**: discuss key topics and concepts at a high level and provide useful background information and explanation.
  * **Tutorials**: provide step-by-step instructions.
  * **How-tos**: are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Section works.
