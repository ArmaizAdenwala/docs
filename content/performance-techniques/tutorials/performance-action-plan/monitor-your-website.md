You may not want to be checking your metrics everyday, but still want to know if something is wrong so you can fix it. With Alerts, you can set benchmarks for your metrics and be alerted via your preferred notification system.

**How do I set up an Alert?** <br/>
Under the Alerts tab you can identify a metric using graphite query string and at what value you want to be alerted. More details on how to set up an Alert [here](https://www.section.io/docs/monitoring-and-alerting/).
