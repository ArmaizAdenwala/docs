**WHY:** Before you make any changes to your cache configuration, we recommend you test them locally first. In order to test, you need to setup your local environment.

**HOW:** To test configuration changes locally, visit our [Developer PoP tutorial](/docs/developer-workflow/). Many customers also choose to integrate a staging site with the Section platform as a part of their developer workflow. If you do not want to do this step, you can skip it and make your changes live on production.
