A key metric when evaluating website performance is **cache hit rate**. Cache hit rate is a measure of how effectively the cache is responding to customer requests. Whenever a request reaches a Varnish Cache instance, one of four outcomes occurs: hit, miss, pass, or synth.

A **hit** means that the cache responded to the request with a cached resource. A **miss** means that the cache tried to respond to the request with a cached resource but could not do so because it did not have a copy of the requested resource in its memory. A **pass** means that the cache did not even try to look up a response for the requested resource â€” often users specifically instruct Varnish Cache to pass on urls that should never be served from cache like `/checkout`, but there are other causes as well. From a performance standpoint, the goal is to increase Hit % and decrease Miss and Pass %.

**Why do you care?:** Whenever the cache answers a customer request, that means the request did not need to be answered by your website origin server. Having a large percentage of cache hits results in performance benefits and reduced costs.

From a performance standpoint, Varnish Cache's quick lookup and response time combined with the geographic distribution of Section's platform means that your users are quickly served a response from a server close to their geographical location. This improves time-to-first-byte and keeps latency low. From a cost-savings perspective, every request that receives a response from cache does not need to connect to your origin server, greatly reducing load. With a finely-tuned caching configuration, your origin only needs to respond to requests for personalized actions such as checkout and and account pages.  

**How do you see it?:** This is the first chart we show you on the Section dashboard. To see this in action on our demo bootcamp application, go **[here](https://aperture.section.io/account/1/application/1/environment/Production/overview)**.
