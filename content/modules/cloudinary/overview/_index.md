## Deliver faster page loads

Image optimization for web is one of the most important elements of delivering faster pages. Having large image files or a high number of individual images can significantly impact load times, and unrendered images result in poor user experience. Cloudinary optimizes all common image file types by compressing them so that visitors receive images that work best with their device type and browser.

Cloudinary can also resize your images on the fly and do face detection among other things.

To see how Cloudinary can optimize all your images, visit the [Cloudinary Documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation).
