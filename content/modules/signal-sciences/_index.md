## What does it do

Providing real-time protection for any application, against any attack, with integrations into any DevOps toolchain.

Signal Sciences was created by CISOs, CTOs, and engineers looking to integrate advanced website security with cloud solutions and DevOps workflows. Signal Sciences analyzes and blocks threats in real-time, with 95% of customers using it in blocking mode, reducing false positives while identifying more threats than other solutions.

Signal Sciences uses contextual information and next-generation cloud analysis to immediately block threats while sending detailed insights to an intuitive dashboard so your development and operations teams can work together to continually improve your web applicationâ€™s security. Signal Sciences integrates with tools you already use including Slack, JIRA, and Kibana so you get detailed insights where you need them, when you need them.
