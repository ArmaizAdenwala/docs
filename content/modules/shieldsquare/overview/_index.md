Secure your application from automated threats with ShieldSquare

ShieldSquare specializes in non-human traffic detection and management. Their best-of-breed bot management solution secures online businesses against automated threats such as content and price scraping, account takeover, gift card fraud, skewed analytics, ad fraud, and application DoS.

ShieldSquareâ€™s bot detection engine utilizes multiple techniques to identify bots including proprietary Intent-based Deep Behavior Analysis (IDBA), user behavior analysis, device and browser fingerprinting, IP reputation, and machine learning. Over 250+ browser parameters are used by proprietary algorithms to build a unique fingerprint of each user. Challenge-response mechanisms such as CAPTCHA helps to build a closed-loop feedback system that dynamically improves the machine-learning models.

Once a bot is detected, ShieldSquare can block, provide alternate content, serve a CAPTCHA challenge, or perform other custom actions. Additionally, these responses can be customized for specific sections of an application.
