## Overview

The modular nature of the Section platform allows you to easily turn the module on or off. When in a disabled state the module acts as a reverse proxy.


### Toggle Virtual Waiting Room

The Virtual Waiting Room can easily be turned on and off using the toggle provided under the Control Visitor Count section.
