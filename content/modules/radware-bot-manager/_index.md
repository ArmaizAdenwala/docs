## What does it do

Secure your application from automated threats with Radware Bot Manager

Radware Bot Manager specializes in non-human traffic detection and management. Their best-of-breed bot management solution secures online businesses against automated threats such as content and price scraping, account takeover, gift card fraud, skewed analytics, ad fraud, and application DoS.

Radwareâ€™s Bot Manager bot detection engine utilizes multiple techniques to identify bots including proprietary Intent-based Deep Behavior Analysis (IDBA), user behavior analysis, device and browser fingerprinting, IP reputation, and machine learning. Over 250+ browser parameters are used by proprietary algorithms to build a unique fingerprint of each user. Challenge-response mechanisms such as CAPTCHA helps to build a closed-loop feedback system that dynamically improves the machine-learning models.

Once a bot is detected, Radware Bot Manager can block, provide alternate content, serve a CAPTCHA challenge, or perform other custom actions. Additionally, these responses can be customized for specific sections of an application.

### Intent-based Deep Behavioral Analysis
