## What does it do

Use the power of Lua to achieve edge side rewrites and much more.

Install and configure Nginx/Lua on a globally distributed Edge Compute Platform with the confidence of DevOps control.

Section takes the complications out of installing and configuring the software by providing you with:

- A fully managed instance of the most up-to-date version.
- Git-backed workflows for easy version control.
- A development environment to test your configurations.

### Rewrite Body Content

Out of the box, the Nginx with Lua module is easily configurable to rewrite the body of the HTML response on the fly to inject scripts, fix broken links, update CSS files, and much more. LUA is an incredibly fast script level HLL language so it is easy to work with and perfect for on-the-fly rewrites.

### HTML Streaming with LUA

Cache the head of every document to improve your time to start render and time to first byte (TTFB) speeds, while maintaining your current code base.

### Complex Routing

Fetch data on the fly from external storage devices to determine the optimal upstream server or origin location to which your Edge Compute Platform should pass each HTTP request.
