Deploy a Node JS module on Section's Edge Compute Platform to run fully featured JavaScript functions on a distributed edge.


#### In addition to lightweight code options, Section supports richer JS at the edge through a completely containerized Node JS module.

As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node is designed to build scalable network applications. In Node, many connections can be handled concurrently. Upon each connection, the callback is fired, but if there is no work to be done, Node will sleep.

HTTP is a first-class citizen in Node, designed with streaming and low latency in mind. This makes Node well-suited for the foundation of a web library or framework.
