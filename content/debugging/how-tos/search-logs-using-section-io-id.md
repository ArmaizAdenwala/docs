In this document and video we show you how to search the HTTP Logs in Section's dashboard by using the value of the `section-io-id' HTTP response header which is present on every response served by Section platform.

### Obtain the section-io-id header value.

If you are using a broswer, you shoulw be able to open up broswer Dev-Tools -> Network, load the page then you should see all the requests the browser made.
Find the request that is of interest and click it. Under Headers, look for the  `section-io-id` response header. It should look something like this:

```
section-io-id: 97031a48002326276ebc1aef2eb40f2d
```
Copy just the value, e.g `97031a48002326276ebc1aef2eb40f2d` then follow the instructions below to search for logs associated with that response.
