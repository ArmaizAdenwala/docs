**HOW** To change your configurations, go to the proxy tab in your Section account. Here you can select configurations you want and we will write the code and deploy or for you. You can also go to the repository tab and edit the config file with your own code or edit using your command line. Details [here](https://www.section.io/docs/basic-configuration/).
