The invited user will receive an email inviting them to join Section and have immediate access to your account. Currently Section does not allow you to change the roles of these users, but if you want the user to have a different role (e.g. only be able to clear cache) please [submit a support ticket](https://support.section.io) and we will get the user's role changed as soon as possible.

The email invitation will only be valid for 48 hours.
