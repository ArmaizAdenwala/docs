This section of the docs provides information on all things related to DNS and Section.

For help changing the DNS records within your existing DNS hosting provider so that traffic runs through Section, please visit our [documentation](/docs/dns/how-tos/set-up-dns-on-other-provider/) and [go-live tutorials](/docs/getting-started/tutorials/going-live/) on making a DNS change to go live.

Although Section is fully compatible with your existing DNS hosting provider (ALIAS record support for bare domains not withstanding), Section also provides DNS hosting. The most common reasons to use Section hosted DNS are to simplify your website management overhead and to get around issues with a hosting provider that does not support ALIAS records for bare domains as [described here](/docs/dns/reference/bare-domains/). Visit [this guide](/docs/dns/how-tos/set-up-dns-on-section/) for help setting up Section hosted DNS.
