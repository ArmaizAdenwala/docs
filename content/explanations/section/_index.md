Section’s Edge as a Service (EaaS) gives Dev and Ops engineers the access and control they need to run compute workloads on a distributed edge.

Being container-based (Docker/Kubernetes), our platform includes the ability to build and bring your own edge module or select from our library of highly available and highly performant edge compute modules.

Section operates across the HTTP delivery path from origin to distributed network, is hosting provider-agnostic (cloud, on-premise, self-hosted, …), and has already been proven to address challenges far beyond traditional CDN workloads.
