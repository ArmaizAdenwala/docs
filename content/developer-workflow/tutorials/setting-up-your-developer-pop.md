Section Developer PoP runs on Kubernetes. Minikube is a miniature, prepackaged Kubernetes cluster that works on locally on desktop Microsoft Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Minikube runs in the free and open source [VirtualBox]. 

1. Verify that you have installed VirtualBox.
1. Download and install <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/tag/v0.35.0" target="Minikube" title="Minikube v0.35.0 download">Minikube v0.35.0</a>. Version 0.35.0 is the Section supported version of Minikube. https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/tag/v0.35.0
1. Start minikube: `minikube start`
1. Initialize the Developer PoP:

```
minikube ssh "docker run --rm --net=host -v /var/lib/minikube:/var/lib/minikube:ro sectionio/section-init"
```

{{% notice info %}}
Depending on the speed of your internet connection and the power of your computer, the initiation of the Developer PoP can take several minutes.

Note that after each one of these terminal commands, you will need to wait a few moments for Minikube to fully launch all the Section containers. If you, for example, try and do the git pushes in the next section immediately after completing the `minikube ssh` command above, you may find that the git daemon or some other relevant component has not yet come online. In this case, just wait for a few minutes â€” the exact time depends upon the speed of your internet connection and specifications of your machine. 

{{% notice tip %}}
Disable repeating messages about the **kubectl** component you won't need: `minikube config set WantKubectlDownloadMsg false`

Now your Developer PoP base is ready, but it has not yet launched any of the specific proxies in your configuration.

Let's change that by [loading your Section setup into the Developer PoP]({{< relref "developer-workflow/tutorials/loading-your-setup-into-the-developer-pop.md" >}}).
