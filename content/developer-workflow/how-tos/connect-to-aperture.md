In the upper right hand corner of the devpop UI, there is a **Connect to Aperture** button. When clicking this it will redirect you to Aperture and prompt you to login and authorize the devpop. If you are successful then the **Connect to Aperture** button will be replaced with a blinking blue icon followed by your email address.

This will enable an **Import** button on the **Operations** column of the services table, which will open up a modal prompting you to select the application you want to import.
