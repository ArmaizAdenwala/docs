## Context

## Steps

Follow the below steps to deploy this change:

1. Locate the `section.config.json` file in the root of your Section git repository.
1. Locate environment block (in this example we'll be using Production).

```json
...
"environments": {
    "Production": {
    "origin": {
        "address": "origin.example.com",
        "enable_sni": true
    },
...
```

1. Add the following key/value to the origin block: `"proxy_acme_challenge": true`

```json
...
"environments": {
    "Production": {
    "origin": {
        "address": "origin.example.com",
        "enable_sni": true,
        "proxy_acme_challenge": true
    },
...
```

1. Commit your changes and push to your desired branch.
