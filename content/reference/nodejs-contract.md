# NodeJS Requirements

The following defines the requirements to run the NodeJS module in the Section platform:

## Essential

* HTTP server listening a port defined by `process.env.PORT` for HTTP/1.1 — never using HTTPS or any other port.
* In the event communicating upstream or to another service you must connect to `next-hop:80` as HTTP, never HTTPS. The platform will ensure `next-hop` resolves to the next proxy in the chain or the origin — whichever is next upstream.
* Proxy must handle logs according to these requirements:  
   * All log files must be written under the `/var/log/nodejs` directory.
* Your config must contain a `.gitignore` file which ignores the `node_modules` directory.
* Your NodeJS config must contain a `package-lock.json`file which is generated by `npm`. 
* Your NodeJS application must contain a npm start script which must start your HTTP server.


## Optional

* Your application should handle run time errors which does not crash the application.

## Things you can rely on

* Module can expect X-Forwarded-Proto request header will equal "https" for HTTPS connections from the browser. Assume HTTP otherwise.
* Module can expect X-Forwarded-For request header will be present.
* Module can expect a True-Client-IP header of the IP address of the client connecting to the Section servers.
